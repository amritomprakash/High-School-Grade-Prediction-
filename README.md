# High-School-Grade-Prediction

This repository holds all the files corresponding to the prediction of High School Grades of a student using Multiple Machine Learning 

algorithms.Each folder corresponds to a particular algorithm and consists of the Jupyter Notebook with the code and a report.

# Algorithms:

1.K Nearest Neighbors

2.Multi Layer Perceptron

3.Support Vector Machines

4.K Means Clustering

5.Principal Component Analysis(To reduce dimensions and boost the accuracy)

6.Random Forest(Ensemble Learning).
